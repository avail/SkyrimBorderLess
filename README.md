# [[ Skyrim Borderless ]]


Make sure Skyrim is in Windowed Mode - it can be set in the launcher.


You will need to have [SKSE Plugin Preloader](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75795/?) for this to 
work.


Once built/downloaded, place it in SKSE's plugins directory 

(Skyrim/Data/SKSE/plugins) and you're good to go!

## Download

dll](https://getrektby.us/dl/RIL.BorderLess.zip)
